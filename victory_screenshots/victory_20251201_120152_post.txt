I’m just honored to have had the opportunity to play alongside such talented teammates who made this small win possible. Honestly, I couldn’t have done it without their support and strategy. It's a true testament to the power of teamwork! #TeamWork

I remain humbled by this experience. Winning might seem like a simple achievement in the grand scheme of things, but it represents many hours of practicing, learning, and just trying to improve.
